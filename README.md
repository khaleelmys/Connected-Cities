# Connected-Cities
application determines if two cities are connected. Two cities are considered connected if thereâ€™s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city to another.

A rest api is exposed which determines the possible path between two cities. If path exists then return "Yes" or "No" in response

# Technologies

Spring Boot 2.x,
Java 1.8,
Maven,
Mockito for Unit testing.

# Implementation Steps

After analyzing the requirement, it is considered to use collection to compute the path between two cities where they are not directly connected

    city.txt - Given a text file consists of pair of cities in each line with comma(,) separated.
    CityUtil.java - Config file reads the textfile and places all the cities in Map collection 
    CityPairController.java - An API is exposed through a rest controller web method - isConnected() which takes 2 inputs origin and destination as Query Parameters
    CityPairService.java - A service class is invoked from controller which process the inputs and compute the path of the cities.
    Endpoints - test in postman.
        http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Newark
        http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=New York&destination=Philadelphia
        http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Philadelphia&destination=Trenton

Unit Testing

Test classes package.
Unit testing carried through Mockito framework, allows the creation of unit tests for the purpose of test-driven development (TDD). Test cases are cover Only controller class for this project. Unit Test classes can run through maven build command or can be execute directly from test class from eclipse editor.

    />mvn clean install

all the test cases passed.
Build Status

    Success
